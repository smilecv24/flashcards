I need to write a software specification, and I need your help with writing it.

I want to build a flashcards app to help learn Spanish in the form of a web application using TypeScript and Vite/React.

Here are some features I think I will need:

Each card should be in Spanish, and I need to know the word in English
It should have the ability to flip cards revealing the word in English
After flipping, below each card I should have two buttons, ask if I got it wrong or right
Remember which cards I got wrong
Feature: to redo only cards I donâ€™t know.
Quiz/Test Mode: Multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank options.
Statistics page: Track how many cards you've studied, correct vs. incorrect answers

The output should be formatted as Markdown.

Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear BEFORE you start generating.
